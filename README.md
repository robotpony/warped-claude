# Warped Claude setup

This is my Claude code setup, tuned for managing my blog, websites, and personal projects.

Summary:

- `commands/` contain some of my older blog and coding skills
- `rules/` contain my writing guidelines, which are always a WIP
- `skills/` is currently unused as I move over some of my development thinking there
