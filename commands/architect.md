# Analyze and consider the problem: $ARGUMENTS

## Possible artifacts

- ARCHITECTURE.md for the data flow, major interfaces, and components.
- DESIGN.md to outline the user facing interfaces (UI, command line interfaces, file formats).
- LIBRARIES.md to outline the libraries used in the project and why
- PLAN.md to outline a phased approach to implementing the described framework.

## Follow these steps

1. Consider the request, use  AskUserQuestion until the problem domain Is clear, and summarize potential approaches.
2. Once an approach is found, continue to use AskUserQuestion to define detail to produce the needed artitifacts.
3. Plan the components, libraries, and general flow. Log all architectural decisions and patterns in ARCHITECTURE.md.
4. Provide a final review of all generated artifacts and identify any consistency differences and gaps.
