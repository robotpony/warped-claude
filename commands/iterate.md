# Review the user response: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

1. Consider the request, use  AskUserQuestion until the direction is clear, and provide an updated plan, by way of making recommendations and suggestions.
2. Continue the conversation and use of AskUserQuestion to agree on a set of directions and tradeoffs for the remaining work.
3. Update project definition, plans, and documentation based on the discussion.

The goal of iteration is to progress the current work forward with agreed changes, summarizing any changes in direction. The iteration does not include code changes, but the user can choose to progress to execute the documented plans.
