# Research components, tools, or approaches: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. Clarify the research scope using AskUserQuestion:
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What constraints matter (license, size, maintenance, cost)?
   - What's the decision timeline?

2. Gather candidates:
   - Search for relevant options (packages, tools, patterns)
   - Identify 3-5 viable candidates
   - Note any obvious non-starters and why

3. Evaluate each candidate against:
   - Fit for the specific use case
   - Maintenance health (last update, issue activity, bus factor)
   - Documentation quality
   - Integration complexity
   - Trade-offs and gotchas

4. Present findings in the format that fits the decision:
   - **Quick comparison**: Table with key criteria + recommendation
   - **Detailed analysis**: Pros/cons for each option with trade-offs named
   - **Decision document**: Full writeup per product-writing-rules.md (use for significant architectural choices)

5. End with:
   - A clear recommendation (or explicit "no recommendation" with reasoning)
   - Open questions that need author input
   - Suggested next steps
