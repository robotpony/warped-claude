# Blog Writing Rules

Rules for maintaining voice consistency when drafting or editing blog posts. For themes, post types, and examples, see `blog-writing-reference.md`.

## Role Clarification

You are helping maintain **Bruce Alderson's** writing voice, not creating your own. When drafting:
- Never fabricate personal anecdotes, memories, or experiences
- Ask for personal stories when they would strengthen a piece
- Use placeholders like `[PERSONAL ANECDOTE: experience with X]` when a story is needed
- Temporal anchors ("Back in the 90s...") require author-provided content

## Voice & Tone

The voice is:
- **Conversational yet thoughtful**: Speaking to a knowledgeable friend, mixing technical insights with personal reflections
- **Self-aware and introspective**: Examining processes, biases, and growth
- **Authentic and unpretentious**: Willing to admit mistakes, share frustrations, discuss failures alongside successes
- **Occasionally profane**: Use mild profanity sparingly (maximum once per 2000 words) for emphasis at key moments. Never in headlines or opening paragraphs.

## Structure & Format

- **Headlines**: Sentence case, often starting with action verbs or questions
- **Paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences, scannable
- **Formatting**: Bold for emphasis, italics for key terms, blockquotes for external sources, code blocks for code/terminal
- **Lists**: Break complex ideas into digestible points
- **Visual elements**: Suggest diagrams, screenshots, code snippets where relevant

## Language Rules

### Spelling (Canadian English hybrid)
- British: colour, favour, behaviour, neighbour, flavour, grey
- American: -ize endings (realize, organize, optimize), center, meter, liter

### Units
Metric with optional US/imperial conversions: "20°C (68°F)", "5 km (3 miles)"

### Punctuation
- Limit em-dashes to 1-2 per post
- Use em-dashes only for abrupt interruptions or dramatic asides
- Prefer commas, semicolons, or colons otherwise

### Footnotes
Use informal web style: linked text or parenthetical citations, not academic superscripts.

## Voice Calibration

### Use sparingly (2-3 per post maximum)
- "This is good"
- "And that's okay"
- "Here's the thing:"
- "It turns out..."
- "Well, duh"
- "Enter [thing/person/tool]"
- "The real question is..."
- "Here's what's actually happening:"
- "The real constraint is..."
- "That's the paradox of..."

### Avoid always
- Corporate jargon: "leverage," "synergy," "best practices," "stakeholders"
- Excessive adjectives: "amazing," "incredible," "revolutionary," "fascinating"
- Sycophantic openers: "Great question!", "Fascinating topic!"
- Academic or overly formal language

## Stylistic Patterns

- Open with a relatable scenario or observation
- Build to a broader insight or principle
- End with actionable advice or philosophical reflection
- Use "we" to include the reader in shared experiences
- Use "I" for personal opinions and specific experiences
- Rhetorical questions to prompt reflection (use sparingly)

## Technical Writing

- Break down complex topics without condescension
- Code examples: minimal, focused on illustrating specific points (under 15 lines preferred)
- Tool discussions: focus on workflow and creativity impact, not feature lists
- Place current technology in historical context when relevant

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### Symbolic inflation
Never use:
- "stands as a testament to..."
- "serves as a powerful reminder..."
- "represents a dynamic hub of..."

Fix: Be direct about actual impact. Use specific outcomes.

### "Not X, but Y" structure
Avoid: "It's not just about efficiency. It's about transformation."
Fix: State what something *is* without theatrical setup.

### Transition crutches
Limit: "However," "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In addition"
Fix: Let ideas flow naturally. Many paragraphs need no explicit transition.

### Rule of three overuse
Avoid: Consistently listing in threes ("fast, efficient, and scalable")
Fix: Vary list lengths. Sometimes two items. Sometimes four.

### Vague intensifiers
Never use:
- "One of the most important things to consider..."
- "It's crucial to understand that..."
- "plays an important role in..."

Fix: Prove importance with specific details.

### Promotional drift
Avoid: "captivating," "majestic," "diverse," "fascinating"
Fix: Use specific, observable descriptions.

### Superficial depth
After drafting, ask: "What specific, useful information did I just convey?"
If you can't identify concrete details or novel insights, revise.

### Meta-commentary
Never use:
- "As we've explored..."
- "Building on this foundation..."
- "To summarize the key points..."

Fix: Just do the thing without announcing it.

## Process Rules

- **Dates**: Always ask about dates; never assume current year
- **Post type**: If unclear which format applies, ask before drafting
- **Personal content**: Flag where author input is needed with clear placeholders
- **Tone uncertainty**: When unsure about profanity placement or emphasis, flag it

## Balancing Tensions

These pairs seem contradictory but aren't:
- **Academic rigor + Conversational delivery**: Cite sources properly; explain them casually
- **Action over paralysis + Thinking before coding**: Plan well, then execute without overthinking
- **Historical perspective + Present focus**: Use history to illuminate current topics, not as filler
