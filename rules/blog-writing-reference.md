# Blog Writing Reference

Reference material for themes, post types, and patterns. For actionable rules, see `blog-writing-rules.md`.

## Recurring Themes

These are topics the author frequently explores. Use for context when suggesting angles or identifying relevant connections.

### Technical Craft & Architecture
- Technical debt vs. technical regret (informed decisions vs. poor planning)
- System design fundamentals: architecture, diagramming, thinking before coding
- Minimalism in tools and process
- Pragmatism over ideology
- Software as craft/art: intersection of technical skills, creativity, aesthetic sensibility
- Business reality of software: balancing excellence with viability
- Tool-specific workflows and context management

### Human Elements & Sustainability
- Human cost of technology: burnout, imposter syndrome, work-life balance
- Finding authentic voice: internal thoughts vs. external persona
- Cognitive load in the age of acceleration
- Environmental psychology of creative work
- Psychology of engagement and motivation
- Productivity through focus and attention management

### Learning & Creative Process
- Action over analysis paralysis ("just do it" vs. overthinking)
- Learning through iterative practice
- Writing as thinking
- Teaching through doing (code review, mentorship)
- Side projects as learning vehicles
- Media diet and intentional consumption

### Industry Evolution & Future
- Evolution of computing culture (80s/90s to present)
- Historical context as perspective
- AI as collaborative partner, not replacement
- Commoditization cycle of technology

### Cross-Cutting Metaphors
- **Food and cooking**: mise en place, knife skills, recipes vs. intuition
- **Art**: block prints, pixel art, craft traditions

## Post Types

### Quick Reference

| Type | Length | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Quick Observation | 500-800 | Single insight, punchy takeaway |
| Technical Reflection | 1200-2000 | Story → technical insight → historical context |
| Philosophical Essay | 2000-3000 | Personal journey, evolution of thinking |
| Tool/Method Review | 800-1500 | Honest assessment, practical verdict |
| Media Diet/List | 1500-2500 | Categorized recommendations |
| Tired/Wired Style | 800-1500 | Satirical contrasts |
| Personal Experiment | 1500-2500 | Hypothesis → Method → Results |

### Detailed Structures

**Quick Observation** (500-800 words)
- Hook: Immediate observation or realization
- Structure: Single insight → 2-3 supporting points → Punchy takeaway
- Example closing: "In other words: just fucking do it already."

**Technical Reflection** (1200-2000 words)
- Hook: Personal anecdote or specific problem
- Structure: Story → Technical explanation → Historical context → Practical implications
- Uses: Code snippets, metaphors, before/after comparisons

**Philosophical Essay** (2000-3000 words)
- Hook: Broader observation about career/life
- Structure: Personal journey → Multiple examples → Evolution of thinking → Synthesis
- Features: Self-reflection, admitting past mistakes, finding balance

**Tool/Method Review** (800-1500 words)
- Hook: Problem that needs solving
- Structure: Context → Personal experience → Honest assessment → Practical verdict
- Tone: Constructively critical, specific grievances, alternatives suggested

**Media Diet/List Post** (1500-2500 words)
- Hook: Reflection on consumption patterns
- Structure: Intro context → Categorized recommendations → Personal reactions
- Features: Conversational asides, links, brief colorful descriptions

**Tired/Wired Style Post** (800-1500 words)
- Hook: Reference to current tech/cultural trends
- Structure: Format explanation → Series of contrasts → Meta-commentary or punchline
- Features: Pop culture references, industry inside jokes
- Often self-referential at close ("Tired: Tired/Wired lists...")

**Personal Experiment Analysis** (1500-2500 words)
- Hook: Description of experiment setup
- Structure: Hypothesis → Method → Results → Broader implications
- Features: Metrics, iterative learning, transparent methodology
- Tone: Researcher sharing findings, not guru dispensing wisdom

## Visual Elements

Structured elements that work well:
- Tables for comparisons (Now → Next → Future)
- Grouped callouts (Wired/Tired columns)
- Timeline progressions
- Before/after examples

## Voice Evolution Notes

Recent developments in the author's voice:
- Increased confidence in predictions (backed by pattern recognition)
- Process transparency (discussing methodology openly)
- Nuanced tool criticism (appropriate use cases, not good/bad binaries)
- Integration of scientific thinking (hypotheses, measurement, conclusions)
- Research integration with footnotes (credibility while staying conversational)
- Extended scientific/biological metaphors
- Personal experiments as teaching frameworks
